Saathi is a mental health portal where people suffering from mental health-related issues seek help from the community anonymously! Some people don't express their emotions publicly & it affects them adversely. This website is an easy way to interact with the people (or volunteers) who are available to help these disturbed people.

### Why Saathi?

1. Saathi gives a platform to anonymously (or not) discuss your problem with the community (or volunteers).
2. There is a blog section dedicated to mental health & well-being related topics.
3. The website has a voice assistant powered by Alan AI to answer user's general questions related to mental health and the website.

### Twilio's SMS API

The user needs to write his/her message in the **message box**. For the demonstration purpose, we are entering the number as we are using Twilio's trial account.

As soon as user clicks on `Send Message` Button, we receive a message of this type,
